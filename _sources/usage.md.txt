# Usage

## Positional arguments

All fields in your pydantic model *without* a default value are converted to cli positional arguments.

```{literalinclude} ../examples/positional.py
:emphasize-lines: 8
```

Help output:

![positional help](_images/positional-help.svg)

A positional argument is required. If you don't provide it an error will be raised. So running this without any arguments will result in the following error message:

![missing argument](_images/positional-error.svg)

## Keyword arguments

All fields in your model *with* a default value are converted to cli optional arguments.

```{literalinclude} ../examples/keyword.py
:emphasize-lines: 8
```

Getting help:

![positional_arg help](_images/keyword-help.svg)

### Keyword arguments with a shorthand

Add a shorthand flag to a positional argument by providing a `short` annotation.

```{literalinclude} ../examples/keyword_with_short.py
:emphasize-lines: 10
```

![positional with short](_images/keyword_with_short-help.svg)

## Choices

A contraint set of values for a certain argument is defined by using the `Literal` annotation.

```{literalinclude} ../examples/choice.py
:emphasize-lines: 10
```

Help looks like this:

![choice argument](_images/choice-help.svg)

Failing to provide a valid value gives you the error:


![wrong choice](_images/choice-wrong-choice.svg)

## Booleans/Flags

A flag (true/false) is defined by the `bool` annotation.

```{literalinclude} ../examples/boolean.py
:emphasize-lines: 8,11

```

`python boolean.py -h`

![boolean help](_images/boolean-help.svg)

## Subcommands

Bigger cli applications will need the use of subcommands.
A probably well known example of this is the git cli with has `git clone ...`, `git merge ...` etc.
A subcommand is implemented by using pydantic models annotated with a `Union`:

```{literalinclude} ../examples/subcommand.py
:emphasize-lines: 28
```

Getting help:

![subcommand help](_images/subcommand-help.svg)

![subcommand sub help](_images/subcommand-merge-help.svg)

When using subcommands, be aware of the following points:

- Only one subcommand per model is allowed. (If you need more (and want to follow the more object-composition path), have a look at [tyro](https://brentyi.github.io/tyro/))
- `sub_command` as a name is not required. Any name will do.
- Nesting of subcommands is possible.

## Validators

Pydantic provides many field validators that can be used in clipstick too.

For example a cli which requires you to provide your age which can (obviously not be negative):

```{literalinclude} ../examples/types_non_negative_int.py
:emphasize-lines: 6
```

When you do provide a negative value, Pydantic raises an error which is picked up by clipstick and presented to the user.

![invalid negative](_images/types_non_negative_int-invalid.svg)

Another example would be a cli which needs a reference to an *existing* file location.

```{literalinclude} ../examples/types_file_exists.py
:emphasize-lines: 6
```

Failing to provide a valid file location gives you:

![invalid file](_images/types_file_exists-invalid.svg)

There are many more out-of-the-box validators available. Have a look [here](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/types/)
It is also pretty easy to write your own validators.
